                        Corazón Contento is a web application designed to support the management of a community kitchen and make resource handling more efficient. The platform includes a login screen, an inventory system, and a dashboard connected to a database. Users can create, delete, update, and read records, providing an organized and reliable tool for daily operations.<br><br>
                        The prototype was first designed in Figma to define the structure and user flows. The final version was developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with Bootstrap as the CSS framework to ensure responsive layouts and consistent styling.

                    <p>Community kitchens often face challenges in managing their resources effectively, such as keeping track of food supplies and maintaining accurate records. Without proper tools, these tasks become slow and error-prone, which impacts their ability to serve people in need. Corazón Contento was created to streamline these processes with a simple and accessible digital solution.<br><br><br></p>

                    <h3 class="black subtitle">Design Process</h3>
                    <p>I began with wireframes and interactive prototypes in Figma to map out the main features and flows of the app. From there, I translated the design into code, developing the interface with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The app was connected to a functional database to make the system more realistic and aligned with real-world use.</p>

                        The application includes secure login, a complete CRUD-enabled inventory, and a centralized dashboard for easy access to data. Its clean interface, combined with responsive design, ensures accessibility across devices and provides an intuitive experience for staff members with varying levels of digital knowledge.<br><br>
                        Corazón Contento demonstrated how digital tools can significantly enhance the efficiency of community kitchens by simplifying the management of essential resources. The prototype not only validated the design approach but also showcased the technical possibility of expanding it into a fully implemented solution.
