                    <p>
                        MotionLab is an educational software designed to make learning physics more interactive, accessible, and engaging for students. The goal was to move away from static explanations in textbooks and provide dynamic visualizations that help students truly understand abstract scientific concepts.<br><br>
                        I joined the project as both a UI/UX designer and front-end developer. My contributions included creating user flows, prototyping in Figma, building a reusable component system, and later implementing several sections of the application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                    <p>Many students find physics abstract and hard to visualize. The challenge was to design an intuitive interface that would help both students and teachers explore concepts more clearly and engagingly.<br><br><br></p>

                    <h3 class="black subtitle">Design Process</h3>
                    <p>I created wireframes in Figma to structure the core sections of the application. Then, I developed interactive prototypes to validate navigation and usability with users. A key step was building a reusable component library in Figma to ensure visual and functional consistency across the interface.</p>

                        The final design included interactive sections for physics simulations, easy-to-use panels for teachers, and a clear visual experience that guides students through each topic.<br><br>
                        The project was selected for ExpoIngenierías 2025 at Tecnológico de Monterrey, where it won first place in the Software Development category. Both teachers and students highlighted the ease of use and clarity of the interface. MotionLab is currently in the process of being implemented at the Tecnológico de Monterrey, Sonora Norte.
