                    <p>
                        Sazón Local is a functional prototype of a mobile cooking app that connects users with recipes based on the products of a local grocery business. The project aimed to encourage home cooking while supporting local commerce by highlighting ingredients that are fresh, accessible, and tied to the community.<br><br>
                        I designed the app in Figma, creating wireframes, high-fidelity screens, and an interactive prototype. The design focused on a mobile-first experience, ensuring that navigation between categories, recipes, and ingredients felt fluid, practical, and visually appealing.

                    <p>Cooking at home can feel repetitive when people don’t know what to do with the ingredients they have. Local businesses also lack digital tools to promote their products effectively. Sazón Local was designed to solve both needs by making recipe discovery simple and tied directly to local products.<br><br><br></p>

                    <h3 class="black subtitle">Design Process</h3>
                    <p>I started by analyzing cooking and supermarket apps like Walmart and Kiwilimon to identify useful patterns. Using Figma, I built wireframes, then high-fidelity screens with a consistent component system. Finally, I created an interactive prototype that simulates the full user experience.</p>

                    <p>
                        The prototype features recipe discovery connected to local products, clear navigation through categories and ingredient details, and a mobile-friendly interface optimized for quick, fluid interactions. The design combines descriptive iconography, structured layouts, and a clean visual style to make the cooking experience intuitive and enjoyable.<br><br>
                        Sazón Local demonstrated how local businesses could strengthen their digital presence through a user-friendly app. The prototype provided a clear vision of the product’s potential and served as a realistic example of how it could be implemented for both users and stakeholders.
