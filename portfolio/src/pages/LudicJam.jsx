              Ludic Jam 2025 was a hackathon focused on videogame development
              that brought together creativity, technology, and
              collaboration. I had the opportunity to participate both as
              Lead Organizer and as a competitor, working alongside a
              multidisciplinary team of women.

            <div className="font-bold">Problem</div>
            <div className="pb-6">
              Beyond organizing logistics, the event needed a visual identity
              and web presence that felt cohesive, drew participants in, and
              reflected the hackathon's core premise: highlighting Sonora's
              cultural importance within a videogame development space.

            <div className="font-bold">Solution</div>
            <div className="pb-6">
              Balancing organizational responsibilities with hands-on
              participation required strong time management, clear
              communication, and adaptability. On the creative side, I
              contributed to the event's visual direction and developed the
              webpage associated with the event, collaborating closely with
              the organization team to ensure a cohesive experience across
              branding, social media, and the site itself.

                  <b>traditional mexican folklore</b> since one of core
                  premises of the hackathon was to highlight Sonora's
                  importance.

              Our game, developed in Roblox Studio, was awarded People's
