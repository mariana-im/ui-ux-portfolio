              Sazón Local is a mobile app prototype that connects users with
              recipes based on products available at a local grocery store.
              The goal was to encourage home cooking while supporting local
              commerce through an intuitive digital experience.

            <div className="font-bold pb-1">Problem</div>
            <div className="pb-6">
              Many users want to cook at home but struggle to find recipe
              inspiration that aligns with locally available ingredients. The
              challenge was to design a mobile experience that simplifies
              recipe discovery while making local products easy to explore
              and integrate into everyday cooking.
            </div>

            <div className="font-bold pb-1">Solution</div>
            <div className="pb-6">
              I designed the full mobile experience from user flows through
              high-fidelity prototypes in Figma, starting with how a user
              moves from browsing local products to discovering a matching
              recipe. Visual hierarchy and wireframing decisions focused on
              keeping ingredient discovery and recipe browsing feeling like
              one connected flow, rather than two separate features bolted
              together.
            </div>

                <div className="pb-6">
                  This prototype demonstrates how thoughtful interface
                  and experience design can translate local commerce into a{" "}
                  digital experience that feels intuitive and easy to
                  use.

                <img
                  className="pb-6"
                  loading="lazy"
                  src={image1}
                  alt="TWO screens from the app showing a log in page and a home page showing a call to action to log in"
                />
              </div>

            <div className="font-bold pb-1">Outcome</div>
            <div className="pb-6">
              {/* TODO: fill in with a concrete result if you have one — course
              grade/feedback, usability testing results, whether it moved
              beyond prototype stage, etc. */}
              The result was a complete, high-fidelity prototype covering the
              full recipe discovery flow, from browsing local products to
              landing on a matching recipe, giving me end-to-end experience
              designing a mobile product from user flows through
              interaction-level detail.

            <div className="pb-6">
              Working on Sazón Local helped me better understand how design
              decisions impact usability at every step of the user journey.
              The project reinforced the value of clear structure,
              consistency, and intentional interactions in mobile
              experiences.
